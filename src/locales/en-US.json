I independently completed all development work for this project. Thanks to its comprehensive and efficient services, it currently boasts about 21,000 users and, with approximately 10,000 daily active users, it has become the largest comprehensive information inquiry platform within the campus."

The system has been deployed on the campus intranet server, specifically designed to meet the unique needs of the college. I was responsible for the secondary development and deployment operation and maintenance work within this project. This includes targeted optimization for the campus system architecture, with a focus on improvements to the database structure, authentication system, routing strategy, and the scheduling mechanism for the distributed judging machines. Additionally, I was in charge of optimizing the corresponding front-end pages to enhance user interaction experience and overall system performance. Through meticulous management and technological innovation, this project has significantly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of campus online assessments, also providing substantial technical support to the college's teaching and assessment system."
